# Super Simple Dev Tutorials
## Description
This is my work with the SuperSimpleDev YouTube web development tutorials.
Website: supersimple.dev
## Process
I follow along the instructions in the videos. They are usually about a large project (e. g. Creating YouTube or Amazon websites).
After each lesson, there are exercises that I do on my own.
## Notes
I created this repository to save my progress as I follow along the tutorials and do the exercises.
I don't check the solution. So, my exercises might be different from the solutions provided by the website.
